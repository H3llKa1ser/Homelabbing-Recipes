Download Link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019 (English (US) 64-bit edition)

### TIP: Rename the downloaded .iso file OR create a separate folder with the name of the server to avoid confusion.

### 1) VM Creation

On the VirtualBox Manager, select:

    Machine -> New

Ensure that the Folder option points to the location where all of your Home Lab VMs are stored.

Select the downloaded .iso image file in the "ISO Image".

Select the "Skip Unattended Installation" option, then click Next.

Next, set the specs for the VM listed below:

    Base Memory (RAM): 4096
    Processors: 1
    Hard Drive Size: 100GB

Confirm all values are correct, then click Finish.

Add the VM to a new group, then rename the group "Active Directory". After that, nest the "Active Directory" group under "Home Lab".

Go to:

    Settings -> System -> Motherboard

In Boot Order, set Hard Disk on top, second Optical. Disable Floppy.

Now go to:

    Settings -> Network -> Adapter 1

In the "Attached to" field, select:

    Internal Network -> LAN 2 (or in our case, LabLAN 3)

### 2) Server Setup

Once the installation is complete, we will be asked to set the password for the Administrator account. Set any password you like (remember this is a Cyber Range Home Lab).

Click Finish.

We won’t be able to log in by using the Ctrl+Alt+Delete shortcut. This will open the system settings menu of the host system.

VirtualBox has a shortcut configured to perform this action. Use the shortcut Right Ctrl+Delete to access the login screen. Login as the Administrator in the VM.
