# Create new interfaces in VMs using VBox CLI

With this method, we can create up to 8 interfaces for each virtual machine. In GUI, we are restricted up to 4 interfaces per virtual machine.

    C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox

Go to:

    Search bar -> Type Environment -> Edit environment variables for your account -> Environment Variables
